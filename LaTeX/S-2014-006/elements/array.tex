\section{\texttt{Array}} \label{sec:array}
\emph{Description:} \par
The \xml{Array} element contains a table of entries with a single line for each grouping of values. This element is used in the \xml{LUT1D}, \xml{LUT3D}, and \xml{Matrix} \xml{ProcessNode}s. The \xml{dim} attribute specifies the dimensions of the array and, depending on context, defines the size of a matrix or the length of a LUT table. The specific formatting of the \xml{dim} attribute must match with the type of node in which it is being used. The usages are summarized below but specific requirements for each application of \xml{Array} are described when it appears as a child element for a particular \xml{ProcessNode}.

\emph{Attributes:}
\begin{xmlfields}
	\xmlitem[dim][required] 	Specifies the dimension of the LUT or the matrix and the number of color components. The \xml{dim} attribute provides the dimensionality of the indexes, where:

		4 entries represent the dimensions of a 3D cube and the number of components per entry.
		\begin{list}{}{\setlength{\itemsep}{4pt}\setlength{\topsep}{0pt}}
				\item e.g. \xml{dim = 17 17 17 3 } indicates a 17-cubed 3D LUT with 3 color components
		\end{list}

		2 entries represent the dimensions of a matrix.
		\begin{list}{}{\setlength{\itemsep}{4pt}\setlength{\topsep}{0pt}}
				\item e.g. \xml{dim = 3 3 } indicates a 3$\times$3 matrix
				\item e.g. \xml{dim = 3 4 } indicates a 3$\times$4 matrix
		\end{list}

		2 entries represent the length of the LUT and the component value (1 or 3).
		\begin{list}{}{\setlength{\itemsep}{4pt}\setlength{\topsep}{0pt}}
				\item e.g. \xml{dim = 256 3 } indicates a 256 element 1D LUT with 3 components (a 3$\times$1D LUT)
				\item e.g. \xml{dim = 256 1 } indicates a 256 element 1D LUT with 1 component (1D LUT)
		\end{list}
\end{xmlfields}
