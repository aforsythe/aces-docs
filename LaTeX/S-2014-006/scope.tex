This document introduces a human-readable text file format for the interchange of color transformations using an XML schema. The XML format supports Look-Up Tables of several types: 1D LUTs, 3D LUTs, and 3$\times$1D LUTs, as well as additional transformation needs such as matrices, range rescaling, and ``shaper LUTs." 

The document defines what is a valid CLF file. Though it is not intended as a tutorial for users to create their own files, LUT creators will find it useful to understand the elements and attributes available for use in a CLF file. The document is also not intended to provide guidance to implementors on how to optimize their implementations, but does provide a few notes on the subject.

This document assumes the reader has knowledge of basic color transformation operators and XML.
