\element{aces:clipIdType / aces:sequence}
        {This element is used to communicate the file sequence information associated with the media files.  The file sequence includes an index indicated by the \texttt{idx} attribute (e.g. \#) that is used to denote the location of frame numbers within the sequence string.  The \texttt{min} and \texttt{max} attributes are used to indicate the minimum frame number and maximum frame number of the sequence.  For example, if the sequence string is \texttt{movieFrame\#\#\#\#.exr} and attributes of \texttt{aces:sequence} are \texttt{idx='\#'}, \texttt{min='0'} and \texttt{min='1000'} the the media files associated with the AMF would be the frames numbered \texttt{movieFrame0000.exr} through \texttt{movieFrame1000.exr}}
